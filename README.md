# UniPort

A simple HTML application that serves as a 'universal portal' for three different datastores of patient information. 

Features include:

1. Access letters using NHS number or Medical Records Number (MRN).
2. Open all letters within tabs in a single browser window - avoids inadvertently mixing up letters of different patients.
3. Create a clickable list from MDT agenda to speed up access to clinical information at MDT meetings.
